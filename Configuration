My configuration for working with C++, Python and JS
1. I work with a dual-booted Linux/Windows system, running Manjaro on a partitioned disk and using WSL 2 on the Windows machine to code in Visual Studio Code.
I installed these plugins to my Windows workspace to make it easier to work on linux later on, since some of them come pre-installed in Manjaro.
2. I use ZSH as my go-to terminal framework, with high configurability & a respectful dollop of features. https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh
3. I use ranger as my go-to file manager, absolutely beautiful work. https://github.com/ranger/ranger
4. I use autojump to use AI to remember my commands and throw them back to improve code speed. https://github.com/wting/autojump
